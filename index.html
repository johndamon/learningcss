            I am a fourth-year Computer Science Animation student at Brigham Young University. I am passionate about programming and how to integrate that knowledge into the animation process. With 3D films becoming increasingly more technical, it will require those who possess the highly technical skills needed to supply the demand. As an admitted student in the Brigham Young University Animation Program, I will continue to hone my technical and artistic skills to leverage the talent that I already possess to aid companies in their process of finding quality candidates, who also represent wholesome family values, to become a part of their fold.

            In my free time, I enjoy being active in my church community by serving those around me. I enjoy playing sports, but mostly volleyball and softball. I also enjoy watching football, basketball, baseball, and soccer. Movies are my passion and I am an avid fan of both live-action and animated films.
